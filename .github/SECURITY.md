# Security Policy

Thank you for reaching out about security! Please note that this project is
maintained on a best-effort basis, however I still intend to prioritize
reviewing and addressing security issues.

## Supported Versions

This software is released at https://nfischer.github.io/framily-tree/. I only
intend to publish security fixes to the GitHub pages instance of this site. I do
not currently publish this package on npm nor do I release versions for other
modules to depend against.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities to ntfschr@gmail.com. I should respond
within a few days. Although it's not strictly required, it helps me out if you
can include any proof of concept exploit code, suggested fix, etc.

**Please do not publicly disclose the suspected vulnerability** until I have a
chance to review your report. I'd like a chance to patch the code before the
issue is known to the public.

Please **only** use this email for security issues. It's also OK to use the
email if you're legitimately unsure if this is a security issue (better safe
than sorry). But for all other non-security issues, please use the GitHub issue
tracker.
